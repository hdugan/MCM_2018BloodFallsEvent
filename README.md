## Data Sources

The data presented here were compiled from three primary sources:

1. **GPS Station TYLG** — Installed in 2017 at approximately 77.7256° S, 162.2653° E on Taylor Glacier ([Gooseff and Doran, 2017](#references)). Daily RINEX data from 9 November 2017 to 5 January 2021 were processed to kinematic positions using the Canadian Spatial Reference System Precise Point Positioning (CSRS-PPP) Version 3 software ([Banville et al., 2021](#references)). The TYLG position time series at 15-second resolution was converted to a daily elevation and velocity time series (Fig. 2a) by collating 15 days of data centered on each day of GPS recording, calculating the median elevation coordinate, and estimating the best-fit velocity to the full-resolution subset of data (between 22,550 and 86,400 data points per processing window).

2. **Time-Lapse Camera System** — Images were collected using a Campbell Scientific CC5MPX camera mounted on a 6-foot Campbell tripod. Photographs were taken daily at 12:01 PM (+13 UTC).

3. **Lake Bonney Water Temperature** — Temperature data from West Lake Bonney were recorded at 10 depths using an RBR Concerto T10 thermistor string deployed at 77.723° S, 162.285° E, approximately 150 m from the glacier terminus ([Lawrence et al., 2020](#references)). Thermistors were spaced vertically 1.44 m apart and sampled at 1-minute intervals with an accuracy of ±0.002°C.
